title: Distilled Water Base Malt Conversion Test
---

You need 50 ppm calcium in your brewing water to make good beer. That's a fact.
You can look it up in How To Brew <sup>[2](#howtobrew)</sup>, or in 
Bru'n Water's Water Knowledge Page<sup>[1](#brunwater)</sup>, or even in
_the_ book on brewing water <sup>[3](#water)</sup>.

Once you do lookup the fact that you need 50ppm calcium, you may wonder: who proved this? Who made this fact a _fact_?
I haven't been able to find that answer. Not that I've _really looked_ all that hard for the answer, but shouldn't it be
_just as easy_ to find as the fact itself?

> "Oh, OK, W.F. McWhozitz proved the 50ppm calcium thing in 1804 after his expedition to Tanzania...that seems right."

I don't understand how you can get away not citing sources for stuff like this?

> "I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor, just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"<br>
> &ndash; Dennis

At this point it's a logical fallacy to even say that 50 ppm fact is, in fact, factual (see: [argument from authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority))
It's just another piece of brewing dogma.

Not. Good. Enough.

However, before committing to any kind of full-blow, multi-week, experiment we first
must examine if there is even a reason to doubt that you need 50ppm calcium.

The oft-cited reasons for needing 50ppm calcium in brewing water:

1. Enzymatic activity in the mash
2. Yeast health/activity
3. Protein coagulation in the fermenter

The results of these problems, in practical terms are, respectively:

1. Your grain's starch will not convert to sugar in the mash.
2. Your beer won't ferment, or will have significant problems fermenting.
3. Your final beer will be hazy.

If you could disprove one of those things, maybe it's worth designing an _actual_
experiment to test the effect of calcium on brewing and the beer it creates.

Idea:
---

* If a mash passes an iodine test, it's starch has been converted.
* If a mash with 0ppm calcium passes an iodine test, calcium is not _strictly_ necessary for mashing.

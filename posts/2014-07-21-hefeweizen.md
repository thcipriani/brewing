Hefeweizen has made me a better brewer—mostly because I can't seem to brew

Pitching rate was the first hard lesson to learn about hefeweizen. When the
idea to brew a hefe first entered my mind I started doing research. I ran

on the Master Brewers Association of the Americas website that cited Narziß
as having stated that 12–18 million cells/mL was an appropriate pitching
rate.
